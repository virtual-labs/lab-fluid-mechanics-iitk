    "introduction": "The virtual fluid mechanics lab provides an interesting and interactive way to learn about fluid mechanics and machinery exercises. It uses a practical approach to study how fluids act when they are still and when they are moving. This V-lab shows the steps needed to do experiments, and then includes a simulation to improve learning.<br>Students can access these studies anytime, which lets them examine results without needing physical equipment. By taking part in these online activities, learners will gain hands-on experience, improve their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and deepen their understanding of fluid dynamics and how it applies in different areas",
